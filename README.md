## Laptop Price Prediction for Kaggle Competition
This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project that predicts laptop prices. The model is built using various machine learning algorithms, including CatBoostRegressor, and is fine-tuned for accuracy using a randomized search for hyperparameter optimization.

## Project Structure
* __pycache__/: Directory containing the Python cache after running the project.
* catboost_info/: Directory to save trained models.
* data/: Directory containing the dataset files.
* Kaggle_Laptop_Price_Competition.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for data exploration, data preprocessing, model development, model training, and evaluation.
* README.md: Project documentation.
* toolbox_ML.py: Python file containing useful functions to work with Machine Learning Project.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, catboost, lightgbm, xgboost, etc.
